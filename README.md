### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. One of the first lessons I learned in this assignment was the importance of being precise with your numbers for calculations.
2. A second concept that I learned was the redundancy of some of the "code" that can be used for each calculation.
3. Another lesson that I learned was the connection of the Javascript file to the HTML file, for instance, clearing the calculator.
